# go-git-prompt

A cross-platform Git status prompt written in Go.

## FAQ

### What is this for?

`go-git-prompt` shows information about a Git repository in the terminal. It is meant to be added to your shell prompt.

### Why another shell prompt project?

Projects like [oh-my-posh]() and [starship]() are fantastic, but offer too many features and look busy. I created `go-git-prompt` because I wanted a solution like [bash-git-prompt](https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt) on Linux **and** Windows.

### What is the project status?

The project is in early development. `go-git-prompt` will be ready for public use in release 1.0.

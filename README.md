A cross-platform Git status prompt written in Go.

## FAQ

### What is this for?

`go-git-prompt` shows information about a Git repository in the terminal. It is meant to be added to your shell prompt.

### Why another shell prompt project?

Projects like [oh-my-posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/) and [starship](https://starship.rs/) are fantastic but overkill for a simple git status prompt. I created `go-git-prompt` because I wanted a solution like [bash-git-prompt](https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt) on **both** Linux and Windows.

### What is the project status?

The project is in early development. `go-git-prompt` will be ready for public use in release 1.0.

## License

`go-git-prompt` is released under the MIT license. Please see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for more details.
